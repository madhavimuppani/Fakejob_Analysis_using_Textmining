# Fraudulent Job Postings Detection Using Text Mining

This project analyzes fraudulent job postings using text mining and predictive modeling techniques. Using a Kaggle dataset with 18,000 job postings labeled as real or fake, the project employs Decision Trees and Logistic Regression models to identify patterns and keywords common in fraudulent postings. 

## Key Highlights:
- **Dataset:** 18 attributes including job title, company profile, description, and more.
- **Models:** Decision Tree (Log/Entropy) achieved the best accuracy of 82%.
- **Insights:** Fraudulent postings often include keywords like "signing bonus" and "career growth" to lure job seekers.
- **Recommendations:** Job seekers should scrutinize company profiles, and job platforms should implement Quality Control Teams to flag suspicious posts.

The repository includes the complete analysis, preprocessing steps, model evaluation, and actionable recommendations for mitigating fraud in job searches.
