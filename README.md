Using a Kaggle dataset with 18,000 job postings labeled as real or fake, the project employs Decision Trees and Logistic Regression models to identify patterns and keywords common in fraudulent postings. 

The repository includes the complete analysis, preprocessing steps, model evaluation, and actionable recommendations for mitigating fraud in job searches.
